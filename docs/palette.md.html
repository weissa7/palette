# Introduction

Palette is a simple application created in Java to provide therapeutic entertainment by providing color representations of audio.
By providing MIDI input through a MIDI keyboard or from a file, Palette will generate a color palette unique to what is played.

# User Guide

## General Information:
This program is intended to be used with a MIDI keyboard and it used to help translate a song in the MIDI format into a color palette to be used by artists or musicians for whatever purpose they may need.

## System Overview:
The program uses MIDI input through a file or the MIDI keyboard and reads the data that is sent/read from the MIDI input or file.
The program uses the data in the MIDI file such as the note, velocity, and other characteristics of the note to determine what the color of the note is.
This application can be used on any operating system as long as Java is installed onto the device.

## Requirements

Java [https://www.java.com/en/download/](https://www.java.com/en/download/) is required to run Palette.

Optionally, a MIDI keyboard may be connected via USB to enhance interaction with the application. Keyboard sold separately.

## Functionality
### From File
![](images/upload.png)

Using the upload feature, you can upload any music track stored in MIDI format (.mid extension).
Palette will automatically create various color palettes that demonstrate the song.

### Live Play
![](images/record_stop.png)

With a MIDI keyboard attached to your computer, pressing the 'record' button will begin a live session where the color palettes will be dynamically updated as you play!

Before playing, a window will prompt asking which MIDI device you would like to use. Select the one that has a name closest to your device.
The application will inform you if the device you selected was incorrect. If no input is detected, there may be a different device that will work.

Once the Live Play session has started, you may begin playing on your keyboard.
The application does not produce sound, so an external program or speaker for the keyboard is needed for audio feedback.

Once completed, press the 'stop' button. You now have the option of saving your play to a MIDI file, or cancelling.

### Algorithms
![](images/algorithms.png)

Palette offers multiple algorithms to generate colors for you. Using the dropdown, select which algorithm you would like to see.
Algorithms may be switched at any time, and do not reset upon switching. This lets you compare colors for the song you are currently viewing.

Current Algorithms available:
 * NoteDistance
 * ColorDrift
 * Scribian

See the Source Descriptions section in the Developer portion of this page for more details on what the algorithms are and how they work.

## Output
![](images/output.png)

The output of uploading / recording a song is a 5-color palette of colors.

The hex values of each color are displayed.

!!! Tip
    You can click on each generated color to copy the hex value into your operating system's clipboard!

# For Developers

## Getting Started

Palette is open source, and is easy to get started working on.
The following technologies are required:
 * [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) - A professional Java IDE by JetBrains.
 * [Java 11 SDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html) - Oracle's Java SDK, latest release.

### Project Setup

Once IDEA is installed, execute the program. On the New Project page, select "Checkout from Version Control" and choose Git.

Provide the project's GitHub URL: [https://github.com/weissa7/palette](https://github.com/weissa7/palette) and the project will be initialized!
Build the project, and the program should be ready to execute.

## Project Overview

## Source Descriptions

This section covers the descriptions of every relevant file available in the project. It is to provide a brief overview of said file. More descriptive
documentation may be found within the files.

(###) ColorDrift (class))

A simple algorithm that generates a color palette based on small movements from a gray center.

(###) HSBColor (class))

A class that utilizes the hue - saturation - brightness color system for holding color information.

(###) NoteDistance (class))

A complex algorithm that utilizes the distance between music notes to generate a complementary color palette.

The best way to describe this algorithm is visually because it splits a color wheel into 12, 30 degree sections, 1 for each note.
The orientation of the sequence is arbitrary, based on where the note with the highest count is placed on the wheel, so the angles wont
necessarily look as pretty as 30, 60, 90; however, they will always be the same 30 degrees from one another


![](images/degrees.png width="400px" height="400")

If we consider a song example where:
C is our most hit note with 100 hits,</br>
D# is our 2nd most hit with 80 hits,</br>
G# is our 3rd most hit with 70 hits,</br>
F is our 4rd most hit with 50 hits,</br>
A# is our 5th most hit with 40 hits,</br>
then we have:

![](images/with_numHits.png width="400px" height="400")

To generate a color palette from this information, we will travel a percentage of the distance between the base color and each of the other 4 most hit notes.

To determine the percentage, we divide each note's number of hits by the base note's number of hits and then multiply the result by 100.

For example, the distance to A# is calculated by taking it's number of hits (40) and dividing it by the base's number of hits (100) and then multiplying the result by 100

The resulting color is highlighted by a teal box

![](images/continuous_A.png)

The same calculation is followed for each of the other notes:

![](images/continuous_G.png)![](images/continuous_F.png)![](images/continuous_D.png)

This is the color palette generated:

(###) PaletteAlgorithm (interface))

An interface to be used when implementing new color-generating algorithms.

(###) PaletteForm (class))

The main program, using Swing to create a GUI interface.

(###) Scribian (class))

This algorithm represents Scribian Correspondence of the notes played. More info on this may be found [here](https://www.flutopedia.com/sound_color.htm).
