# Introduction

Palette is a simple application created in Java to provide therapeutic entertainment by providing color representations of audio.
By providing MIDI input, either by using a MIDI keyboard or from file, Palette will generate a unique color palette to said song.

## Development - Getting Started

Palette is open source, and is easy to get started working on.
The following technologies are recommended/required:
 * [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) - A professional Java IDE by JetBrains.
